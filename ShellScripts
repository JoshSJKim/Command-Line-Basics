## Shell Scripts

- Take frequently repeated commands and save them in files to rerun the saved operations as needed by typing a single command.
- These saved commands are called `shell scripts`, but remember that these are actually small programs.

- Some advantages of using `shell scripts`.
  - Increased efficiency
  - Improved accuracy (not having to worry about typos by re-entering same commands repeatedly)
  - Can be shared with colleagues if multiple people are working on a single project (improved consistency)

### Writing Shell Scripts

- Use the `nano` text-editor in the shell to create a `.sh` file in the desired directory (`alkanes` directory is used for this example)
  - `nano middle.sh` will open up the text editor on the shell screen
  - Write the necessary commands and `ctrl + O` save (press enter) and `ctrl + x` to close the editor.
    - `head -n 15 octane.pdb | tail -n 5`
    - This command will retrieve the data lines 11 to 15 in the `octane.pdb` file
  - If the file does not exist, it will be created.

### Executing Shell Scripts

- Once the `.sh` file is saved in the directory, execute the command by entering the following
  - `$ bash middle.sh` or `$ zsh middle.sh`, both works identically in my case.
